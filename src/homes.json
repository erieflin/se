Our Sober Living Environment is Co-Ed and provides a next generation solution to those in the recovery community looking for a smooth transition from sober living, sober living homes, or rehabilitation treatment centers.  HHSLA is apartment style, allowing each resident to have his or her own private room. Our communal recovery community features eight units that have two bedrooms to an apartment and each unit is gender specific. Other features includes onsite management and bi-weekly urinalysis testing. If you are a working professional or college student the quiet apartment style living option may be preferable over traditional sober living homes.  All of the apartments are in the same building to create a communal attitude and peer-to-peer networking. There is a 90 day minimum sobriety requirement for residency in order to maintain an atmosphere of stability."},{"id":"SE007","mapLink":"cv64/se/media/0map.png","homeLink":"cv64/se/homes/se7/","imageCount":"1,2,3,4,5","address":"109 Sunridge Street Playa del Rey, CA 90293 ","price":"","title1":" Casa Nuevo Vida - Playa Beach","title2":"","description":""},{"id":"SE008","mapLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/3380+Sweetwater+Mesa+Rd,+Malibu,+CA+90265…5!3m4!1s0x80e81fd52ca43611:0xbcbd354ce7fbda48!8m2!3d34.041226!4d-118.67567","homeLink":"cv64/se/homes/se8/","imageCount":"1,2,3,4,5","address":"","price":"$6,000 per Month","title1":"1st ( Sweet Water Mesa Sober L","title2":"","description":""},{"id":"SE009","mapLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/3362+Sweetwater+Mesa+Rd,+Malibu,+CA+90265…!3m4!1s0x80e81fd52e697407:0xdbe7d1643edd83a6!8m2!3d34.041618!4d-118.675452","homeLink":"cv64/se/homes/se9/","imageCount":"1,2,3,4,5","address":"","price":"$12,500 per Month","title1":"2nd ( Serra Bluff Sober Living","title2":"","description":""},{"id":"SE010","mapLink":"https://www.google.com/maps/place/20600+Eagle+Pass+Dr,+Malibu,+CA+90265/@34…!3m4!1s0x80c2a0fcd7306eed:0x80f655c0dd62798d!8m2!3d34.043125!4d-118.629719","homeLink":"cv64/se/homes/se10/","imageCount":"1,2,3,4,5","address":"","price":"","title1":"","title2":"","description":""}]
